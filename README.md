The goal of this project is to create a fully functional food delivery system. Using the python library, I created a user interface to receive orders in Telegram. The Database and Administrator panel are created using SQL, HTML, CSS, and PHP. The Database and administrator panel are still in progress and are being part of the class I am currently attending - CS306 Database Systems.
